The whole idea behind Browsah isn't to offer another lib to do and manage HTTP requests in ruby. We believe that REST with hypermedia driven applications, must to use a lib that support the same features as a browser does, such as local caching, representation handling, plugable modules, and son on.

## Initial proposed features ##

- simple and functional DSL to do HTTP requests with full access and control to the internals
- plugable architecture (Rack based)
- local caching support with configurable store
- easy access to resources and link navigation
- management of authentication
- easy control of the REST flow
- flexibility to choose the HTTP library used on background
- asyncronous requests paradigm
- [put your proposal here]
